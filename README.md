# RoadToHealth
Road to Health is a digital version of the child health booklet used across clinics in South Africa. The app helps parents, caregivers, and healthcare workers track a child’s growth, vaccinations, developmental milestones, and important health visits — all in one easy-to-use mobile platform.
